These notes are taken by [Lynn Pepin](https://lynndotpy.xyz/) as personal notes and later reference. There are many abridged Rust texts, and this one is mine.

I abridge [the original work by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/),* with additions from the Cargo book by TODO, the Rust Necronomicon by TODO, and the Rust-by-Example by TODO.

If you have Rustup installed, **you have the full documentation, available offline!** Run `rustup doc` to open the book, `rustup doc --cargo` to open the Cargo book, and `rustup doc -h` to see a full list of available docs.

Chapter names are taken from from [the videogame Celeste](https://celeste.ink/wiki/Main_Page). Each chapter will cite the source material with plenty of links for deeper reading. *Celeste fans, consider these links "the B sides".*
